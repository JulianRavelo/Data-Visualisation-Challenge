# Data-Visualisation-Challenge
## Description
I've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. In a recent study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.  

I was asked to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and a top-level summary of the study results.
## Results
See below some of the tables and figures obtained by the analysis.
